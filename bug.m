In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises from the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` within custom classes that manage memory manually.  Consider a class `MyObject` with a property that points to another object:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) AnotherObject *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)dealloc {
    [anotherObject release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

If `anotherObject` is set multiple times without releasing the previous object, this will lead to memory leaks.  Additionally, if `anotherObject` is released in `dealloc` but also released elsewhere in the code, it could lead to double-release and crashes. This is particularly problematic when dealing with complex object graphs and inheritance.
