The solution leverages Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), introduced in Xcode 4.2, to simplify memory management. This eliminates the need for explicit `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` calls.  If you are working on a project where ARC is not available, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use `strong` and `weak` references:**  Replace `retain` with `strong` and `assign` with `weak` when appropriate.  The compiler will take care of memory management.

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) AnotherObject *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyObject
// dealloc is no longer needed when using ARC
@end
```

2. **Handle object lifecycle carefully:**  If you must handle memory management manually (due to an older project without ARC), ensure that every `retain` call has a matching `release` and avoid multiple releases of the same object. Consider using `@property (nonatomic, assign)` if the object is handled elsewhere and you do not want to take ownership.

3. **Use ARC if possible:** Migrate your project to use ARC for more robust memory management and simplification.
